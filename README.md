-  Using built-in functions like len(), min(), max(), and sum()
-  
   PURPOSE:

   
The goal of this program is to help learners understand how lists work in Python and how they can be applied in everyday coding tasks. Lists are one of the most powerful and flexible data structures in Python, making them essential for problem-solving and project developmeNT


FEATURES:

- Interactive examples with clear outputs
- Well-commented code for easy understanding
- Covers both basic and slightly advanced list operations
- Can be extended into mini-projects (e.g., student progress tracker, shopping cart system, etc.)
